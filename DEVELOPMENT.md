# Main Logic
Minimax function:
```js
minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, isMaximizing)
```

# Timeframe: 40 hrs over 3 wks

---

# Used:
1. Vanilla JS (ES6) - core logic, classes, and algorithms
2. HTML/CSS - design
3. Tailwind CSS - utility first framework for UI polish

# Researched:
1. Data structures - 64 square array representation for piece tracking and state copying
2. Algorithms - minimax with alpha-beta pruning, and my own algorithm for piece movement
3. Heuristics - basic material and positional scoring for evaluating function
4. Architecture - implemented clear object oriented design, code is strictly separated into 'Board' class and 'Engine' class
