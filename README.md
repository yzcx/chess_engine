# Chess Analyser

My chess analyser demonstrates the minimax search algorithm which serves as proof of my ability to handle complex problems in game theory and computational strategy.

## Core
The project explores limits of algorithmic calculation and the necessity of heuristics. This concept has been inspired by my interest in 
Gödel's incompleteness theorem, reflecting the boundary between theoretical and computational possibility. The system has been designed to demonstrate that the engine's success is ultimately bound by finite proof, the search depth.

## Goal
My primary goal was to implement the Alpha-Beta pruning optimisation. Without this technique, the search space grows exponentionally. Alpha-Beta pruning allowed the engine to achieve very optimal search efficiency which made the calculations feasible.

To use:
As White, move a piece on the board to set the position you want analysed. Click calculate then the engine (Black) will execute the single best possible move found by the algorithm. The result evaluation will be displayed in Centipawns
