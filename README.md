# chess_engine

My chess analyser demonstrating the Minimax Search algorithm in chess. This serves as proof of high branching game theory calculations.

My primary goal was to implement the Alpha-Beta pruning optimisation. Without this technique, the search space grows exponentionally. Alpha-Beta pruning allowed the engine to achieve very optimal search efficiency which made the calculations feasible.

This engine visually explores the limits of algorithmic calculation and the necessity of heuristics, a concept that is directly inspired by my research into Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and the boundary between theoretical and computational possibility.

To use:
As White, move a piece on the board to set the position you want analysed. Click calculate then the engine (Black) will execute the single best possible move found by the algorithm
